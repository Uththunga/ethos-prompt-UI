# EthosPrompt Service Pages Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies critical issues across EthosPrompt's four service pages that are preventing optimal conversion rates and user experience. Based on the detailed user journey analysis, significant gaps exist between current implementation and conversion best practices.

## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® **HIGH PRIORITY - Immediate Conversion Impact**

#### 1. Missing Exit-Intent Capture (All Pages)
**Issue**: No exit-intent popups to capture leaving visitors
**Impact**: Losing 60-80% of visitors without any lead capture attempt
**Current State**: No exit-intent functionality implemented
**Recommended Fix**: Add exit-intent popups with relevant lead magnets

#### 2. Inadequate Mobile CTA Placement (All Pages)
**Issue**: CTAs not optimized for mobile thumb navigation
**Impact**: Poor mobile conversion rates (mobile = 70% of traffic)
**Current State**: CTAs may be too small or poorly positioned on mobile
**Recommended Fix**: Implement sticky mobile CTAs and optimize button sizes

#### 3. Missing Progressive Profiling (All Pages)
**Issue**: No email capture before main contact form
**Impact**: Missing 70-85% of potential leads who aren't ready for full contact
**Current State**: Only main contact form available
**Recommended Fix**: Add ROI calculator email gates and progressive forms

#### 4. No Cross-Service Navigation (All Pages)
**Issue**: Users can't easily discover related services
**Impact**: Missing 40% of potential cross-sell opportunities
**Current State**: No "Related Services" or service comparison tools
**Recommended Fix**: Add related services sections and comparison tools

#### 5. Inconsistent Urgency Messaging (Varies by Page)
**Issue**: Urgency banners have different expiry dates and messaging

#### 8. Inconsistent Pricing Display
**Issue**: Different pricing formats across services
**Impact**: Confusing user experience and comparison difficulties
